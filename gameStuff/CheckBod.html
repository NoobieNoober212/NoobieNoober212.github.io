        <h3>The body of the <i>thing</i> you just killed had nothing but crumpled up papers. Coming up to the second body, as you feel through it's pockets it's eyes open instantly. You stumble back as it jumps up and starts running towards you. Sword by your side you attempt to life it up and swing. You swing. Swing too slow. Too, too, slow. It collides with you and you drop your sword. Hitting the cold stone floor as it bites deep into your jugular vein. Causing a huge spike of pain. Fortunately, you're able to throw it off you. As it attempts to recover you roll over, grab the sword, and behead it. You drop the sword, blood flowing fast from your neck. You stumble to your knees and attempt to cover your wound and apply pressure. It does not work. You lean against the wall. You can feel the blood flowing through your fingers, pooling on the floor.</h3>
