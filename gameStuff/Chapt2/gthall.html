        <h3>As you walk through the doorway you hear what can only be described as a rather, <i>odd</i> sound. Turning around you see the body of the other corpse start convulsing in seizure like actions. You instantly bring your sword up and get in a defesnive stance, slowly backing through the doorway back into the hallway. The convulsions stop after about 10 seconds, before the <i>thing</i> jumps to it's feet and lunges at you, crossing the distance in seconds. You try to swing your sword but the blade gets caught in the doorway. It;s body collides with yours and you are flung onto the floor. Pain shoots through your left arm as you land awkwardly. You are able to launch the thing off your body and you stumble into the dark room as it runs at you. It quickly catches up with you and you are both flung into a dark ravine. You let out one final scream as you and the <i>thing</i> fall to your deaths.</h3>
